# minddrawplay

The code is written in C++, Qt 5.6.0

The project is specifically made for mobile EEG device MindWave NeuroSky,
but also can work with other EEG devices (with less features) through BCI2000 module.

MindDrawPlay – is a project of experimental interactive audio-visual art, 
representing translation of brain waves to drawing, graphical and musical space controls. 
It has been grown on a base of a research work in the direction of Brain-Computer Interfaces. 
Combining both latest technology advances – such as mobile EEG devices and musical knowledge – 
such as pentatonic scales, it allows everyone literally to see, to hear his brain activity 
represented by set of sounds and to use brain waves as a brush for drawing or as a parameters 
for image filtering and changes in a graphical flow or in a simple puzzle gathering game.
