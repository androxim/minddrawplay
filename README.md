# minddrawplay

The code is written in C++, Qt 5.6.0

The project is specifically made for mobile EEG device MindWave NeuroSky,
but also can work with other EEG devices (with less features) through BCI2000 module.

MindDrawPlay – is a project of experimental interactive audio-visual art, 
representing translation of brain waves to drawing, graphical and musical space controls. 
It has been grown on a base of a research work in the direction of Brain-Computer Interfaces. 
Combining both latest technology advances – such as mobile EEG devices and musical knowledge – 
such as pentatonic scales, it allows everyone literally to see, to hear his brain activity 
represented by set of sounds and to use brain waves as a brush for drawing or as a parameters 
for image filtering and changes in a graphical flow or in a simple puzzle gathering game.

There are two main windows in the application, 1st is “MindPlay”, 
allowing translation of brain waves to music by playing samples of tones 
from 2 tank drums and 1 hang drum with any background image, which can be filtered 
at the same time with effects (blurring and change of colors), which parameters 
are related to brain activity. 

2nd window is “MindDraw” with 3 different modes representing various graphical spaces 
and controls of them. In all modes there is an option to see in real time brain waves and attention, 
meditation levels on the plots. It represents your brain activity patterns, when you look on 
the application window or do something there. Therefore, you can see how your interactions influence 
your brain activity, for example, when you start drawing line – your attention and beta waves usually increase. 
There is an option for combining drawing with music – when your attention/meditation level is higher 
than some value (like 80% or adaptively computed value) – musical space is activating.
